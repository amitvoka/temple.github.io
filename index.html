                <h3>Quantum Entangled Microdrones Networks</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>Quantum Entangled Microdrones are entangled communication networks that transfer qubit of data to each other.</h4>
                    The quantum satellite is a cornerstone towards practical free-space quantum network and
overcomes the photon loss over large distance. However, challenges still exist including real-time
all-location coverage and multi-node construction, which may be complemented by the diversity
of modern drones. Here we demonstrate the first drone-based entanglement distribution at allweather conditions over 200 meters (test field limited), and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Sparameter exceeds 2.49 àµ‡ 0.09, within 35 kg take-off weight. With symmetric transmitter and
receiver beam apertures and single-mode-fiber-coupling technology, such progress is ready for
future quantum network with multi-node expansion. This network can be further integrated in
picture-drone sizes for plug-and-play local-area coverage, or loaded onto high-altitude drones for
wide-area coverage, which adds flexibility while connecting to the existing satellites and ground
fiber-based quantum network.Quantum network is the ultimate solution for secure data transferring, where an unknown
quantum state cannot be copied or amplified1
. However, this quantum nature sets a poor tolerance
to photon loss in the network channels, which limits the communication distance and data rate with
the existing fiber networks2-4. Therefore, the free-space quantum network 5-7 is a natural solution
to overcome this problem. So far, efforts have been focused on the satellite-based free-space
quantum networks8-11, which enable large-distance satellite-ground links, taking advantage of the
low scattering loss in the empty space. Based on comprehensive ground and aerial-based
experimental tests12-17, up to 1203 km entanglement distribution has been achieved with such
quantum satellites9, 18-21. However, the existing quantum satellites may not fulfill all the
requirements of a practical quantum network. First, the low-orbital satellites can only establish the
quantum data link for certain ground locations within a limited time window. Second, it is difficult
and expensive to build a scalable quantum network with multi nodes using only satellites, as the
link distance between the satellites is limited by the spaceborne beam apertures. On the other hand,
the drone, or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)22, 23 has undergone an explosive development24, 25
because of the breakthrough in the automatic flight control system and artificial intelligence. It
covers a take-off weight from a few grams to tens of tons, a cruising altitude from meters to over
20 km, and a flight duration of up to 25 days26. Therefore, these various drones can be used to
establish the on-demand and multi-node quantum network connection for real-time coverage at
different space and time scales, and the scale can be from a local-area network of hundreds of
meters to a wide-area network up to hundreds of kilometers. By connecting such portable quantum
nodes with the existing satellites and ground-based nodes, a quantum network with full and broad
coverage can be expected, as shown in Fig. 1a.
Generally, the beam diffraction is a fundamental problem for a free-space quantum network,
where diffraction loss dominates over large distances such as the satellite-to-ground distance. In a
drone-based network, however, multi-nodes can be applied to divide a long link into shorter links.
In this case, each drone node can receive a photon and retransmit it to the next node for cascaded
transmission. Symmetric transmitter/receiver beam apertures and single-mode-fiber (SMF) coupling technology are keys for this multi-node quantum network architecture, and reasonable
beam aperture can be used to achieve a satisfactory low link loss27. As shown in Fig. 1b, 2.79 dB
loss can be achieved for a 100 km link with only 300 mm beam aperture, and such link distance is
within the earth-curvature-limit at 20 km altitude, where a space-like scattering loss can be
achieved in the turbulent-free air. In a smaller scale, a local network can be easily established with
much smaller beam apertures and thus airframe weight/sizes (Fig. 1c and d), and a future portable
quantum node can be as small as a modern commercial picture drone.
